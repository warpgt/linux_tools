Scripts helps working with linux specialy when you move from windows and get used to one file instalations

Scripts use *apt-get* inside. You type software name like when using *apt-get*

***Tested on ChaletOS [a most stable linux distribution i've tried](https://sites.google.com/site/chaletoslinux/home)***

**offline_downloads.sh** downloads needed \*.deb files and compress them into one zip file (like setup.exe files in windows)

Script generate file e.g: *NAME*_install.zip. Where *NAME* is software name. Script adds *_install* suffix.

**offline_install.sh** install ready \*.zip files generated by *offline_downloads.sh*

When using *offline_install.sh* you only use *NAME* before these suffix. e.g **gimp**_install.zip

Very simple scripts which do theirs job, but **if you have ideas how to improve them please give me feedback**.

Scripts don't show:
* progress 
* reason why they can't install software (for example whe you have problem with packages dependency)
